## Roadmap for Why I Science

### Project Description

Trust in science and expertise is at an all time low. There is an overall perception of elitism in science that we as scientists need to respond to. There is a perception of scientists live in their ivory tower, isolated and out of touch from the rest of society, and not having the public's interest at heart. The goal of *Why I Science* is to humanize the hardworking people who do science, the scientists who work in the trenches, especially the postdocs, staff, and students who have dedicated their lives to helping people. Inspired by Dan Savage's *It Gets Better* project, we propose to help scientists (especially diverse scientists) to share videos about themselves and their inspirations and reasons why they work in science. 

Our project will have multiple stages:

1. Conceptualization of Project
2. Developing effective video templates
3. Pilot Test Workshop
4. Deployment
