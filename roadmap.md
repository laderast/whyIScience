# Roadmap for Why I Science

## Project Description

Trust in science and expertise is at an all time low. There is an overall perception of elitism in science that we as scientists need to respond to. There is a perception of scientists live in their ivory tower, isolated and out of touch from the rest of society, and not having the public's interest at heart. We need to counter the perception of elitism with our passion for helping the world through science.

The goal of *Why I Science* is to humanize the hardworking scientists who work in the trenches, especially the postdocs, staff, and students who have dedicated their lives to helping people. Inspired by Dan Savage's *It Gets Better* project, we propose to help scientists (especially diverse scientists) to share videos about themselves and their inspirations and reasons why they work in science. 

Our project will have multiple stages:

1. Conceptualization of Project
2. Developing effective video templates
3. Pilot Test Workshop
4. Deployment
5. Evaluation

## Timeline

### 1. Conceptualization of Project

We need help with figuring out questions and stories that will be engaging to the public. Do you have any ideas or want to share your story? Or know someone else who might want to share their story?

In this stage of the project, we need first collect stories about science, especially lower level and early-career scientists (postdocs, staff, and students) about why they do science, using the following questions:

1) Who inspired you to do science when you were young?
2) What is your day like as a scientist?
3) What keeps you motivated when things are tough?
4) How do you hope your work will impact the world?

For more information, please see [Your Story of Science](yourStoryOfScience.md) here.

[Share your story as part of this issue!](https://github.com/laderast/whyIScience/issues/1) We also welcome any other questions or perspectives! 

At this point, we need to think about our audience and understand why they distrust science. What are the cultural issues that we need to engage? How can we be friendly and not dismissive? How can we start a dialogue? What are the stereotypes of scientists that we need to address? If you have insight to cultural barriers to reaching people, [please add to this issue here](https://github.com/laderast/whyIScience/issues/3).

### 2. Development of Video Templates

Using the results of this survey, we will attempt to develop templates to help scientists to present their own stories effectively. This may take the form of scripts to organize their thoughts, or even as video templates in online editors to make assembling their videos easier. 

Feedback about how to make the process of making a video easier would be very helpful. [Add any suggestions to this issue.](https://github.com/laderast/whyIScience/issues/2)

### 3. Pilot Workshop

Based on the feedback from parts 1 and 2, we plan to host a 2-3 hour pilot workshop at OHSU and invite participants to develop their scripts and videos. We will coach students and perhaps have some video stations where participants can record their video, or show people how to record their templates. 

The output of this workshop will be the first wave of videos, and insight on how to tailor the process, and have others hold workshops as well.

### 4. Recruitment of Contributors

After the workshop, we want to spread the word to as many early-career scientists as we can to share their story, both through in person workshops and these story building tools we developed in phases 1, 2, and 3. 

We also want to identify potential audiences and how to reach them. 

### 5. Evaluation

We will evaluate the impact of this campaign in terms of both participants (number of participants who made videos), and number of views, with geographical location. We will also have updatable infographics and a video website featuring especially inspiring videos, and a mailing list for contributors and users.

### 6. Reiterate and Repeat

What worked? What was engaging? How can we make better videos?

### 7. Beyond

More ideas include a podcast and other types of community engagement. We want to develop models to work with current community groups that are interested in promoting science, especially in diverse and disadvantaged populations.
