# Roadmap for Why I Science

## Project Description

Trust in science and expertise is at an all time low. There is an overall perception of elitism in science that we as scientists need to respond to. There is a perception of scientists live in their ivory tower, isolated and out of touch from the rest of society, and not having the public's interest at heart. The goal of *Why I Science* is to humanize the hardworking scientists who work in the trenches, especially the postdocs, staff, and students who have dedicated their lives to helping people. Inspired by Dan Savage's *It Gets Better* project, we propose to help scientists (especially diverse scientists) to share videos about themselves and their inspirations and reasons why they work in science. 

Our project will have multiple stages:

1. Conceptualization of Project
2. Developing effective video templates
3. Pilot Test Workshop
4. Deployment
5. Evaluation

## Timeline

### 1. Conceptualization of Project

In this stage of the project, we will survey lower level scientists (postdocs, staff, and students) about why they do science, using the following questions:

1) Who inspired you to do science when you were young?
2) What is your day like?
3) What keeps you motivated when things are tough?
4) How do you hope your work will impact the world?

We plan to submit this project to the Mozilla Global Sprint to solicit responses. To this end, we need to meet the requirements at [Mozilla Sprint](http://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint).

At this point, we need to think about our audience and understand why they distrust science. What are the cultural issues that we need to engage? How can we be friendly and not dismissive? How can we start a dialogue? What are the stereotypes of scientists that we need to address?

### 2. Development of Video Templates

Using the results of this survey, we will attempt to develop templates to help scientists to present their own stories effectively. This may take the form of scripts to organize their thoughts, or even as video templates in online editors to make assembling their videos easier. 

### 3. Pilot Workshop

We will host a 2-3 hour workshop at OHSU and invite participants to develop their scripts and videos. We will coach students and perhaps have some video stations where participants can record their video, or show people how to record their templates. 

### 4. Recruitment of Contributors

Hopefully, the survey will have kindled interest in the project. We will use this list of people to start recruiting people to the project.

### 5. Evaluation

We will evaluate the impact of this campaign in terms of both participants (number of participants who made videos), and number of views, with geographical location. We will also have updatable infographics and a video website featuring especially inspiring videos, and a mailing list for contributors and users.

### 6. Beyond

More ideas include a podcast and community engagement. We want to develop models to work with current community groups that are interested in promoting science, especially in diverse and disadvantaged populations.
