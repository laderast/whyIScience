## Your Story of Science and How It Can Help People

There is much contempt for scientists and what people term the elites: many times, scientists are 
made to be these isolated boogeymen who don't

This is where your story can help. By adding your story of science to the discussion, you make
a counter story to these 

### Why Do You Science?

In order to tell your story, you must get at your emotional motivations for continuing on in 
your scientific career. Here are some ideas to communicate your story of science.

1. *Who Inspired You*? Oftentimes, as children, we were inspired by someone, whether someone
we knew (one of our science or math teachers who encouraged us) or someone in the news or
a scientist whose story inspired us, such as Marie Curie, Charles Darwin, Gallileo. 

2. *What was the moment that made you want to continue doing science*? Successful scientists
often gloss over the struggle it is to do science, either because they want to make it seem
effortless, or because they have suppressed it. But we all have stories where we had to 
persist in the face of continuing frustration (perhaps an unsupportive department, or weeks
of experiments not working). What made you persist in science despite these frustrations?

3. *What makes you unique will help you connect with others*. Try to make your story personal,
not generic. If you are quirky, don't hide it! Those traits make you human. Think of it this
way: there is perhaps a lonely kid out there who thinks that they are the only one who's 
weird. Show them that your weirdness makes you you, and that it makes you do good science.

4. *Less rehearsed is better than more polished*. Again, I think as scientists, we struggle 
to project an air of authority by making all of our work polished. I think that very
few of us can project this polished air. Instead, it often comes off as stilted and awkward.
Don't worry about too many ums. Aim to capture that emotional moment. 

5. *Be grateful for your opportunities*. We are all hard working people. But sometimes we
forget that doing science is a privilege granted to us by the public, who fund our work.
