# Welcome to *Why I Science*!

## We make movies about hard working people who think and learn. We show that they are not so different and that they help people.

Trust in science and expertise is at an all time low. There is an overall perception of elitism in science that we as scientists need to respond to. There is a perception that scientists live in their ivory tower, isolated and out of touch from the rest of society, and not having public interest at heart. 

The goal of *Why I Science* is to humanize the hardworking scientists who work in the trenches, especially the postdocs, staff, and students who have dedicated their lives to helping people. Inspired by Dan Savage's *It Gets Better* project, we propose to help scientists (especially diverse scientists) to share videos about themselves and their inspirations and reasons why they work in science. 

Please refer to the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for the current plan and future goals for the project.
