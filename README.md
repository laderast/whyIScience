# Welcome to *Why I Science*!

## We make movies about the hard working people who think and learn about the world. We show that they are like everyone else and that they want to help people.

The goal of *Why I Science* is to show that scientists are everyday people who want to help others. Many of the scientists who work in the trenches, especially the postdoctoral researchers, staff, administrators, and students have dedicated their lives to helping people. We work for very little pay in our mission to help others. We work to find better treatments for patients, improve the stuff we use everyday, and make our lives better.

We want to help scientists (especially diverse scientists) to share videos about themselves and their inspirations and reasons why they work in science. We want to connect scientists to their communities and to start talking and listening.
